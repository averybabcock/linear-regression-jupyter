The purpose of the assignment was to create a scatter plot with two variables from our regression_data.csv dataset that was read using pandas to read the data and matplotlib in python. "Dataset" and "model" was used in R to make the scatter plot and fit a linear model. I then fit a linear regression model and plotted the regression line. This was done in Python by using plt.plot. In R, I used ggplot2 to overlay the regression line. In Python, you use color="blue" to make the color, but in R you use colour = 'red'. For x and y labels on Python you use plt.xlabel(""), but on R you use xlab(''). I then evaluated the models performance by getting the R-squared value. model.score was used in Python to do this, but in R, it is just summary(model). The data was then saved and exported.
